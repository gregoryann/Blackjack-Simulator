# Blackjack

* 2 or more players.
* 1 Dealer
* Deck of 52 cards times 6 so total of 312 cards
	* Ace card has value of 1 or 11
	* Face cards have value of 10
	* other cards have their respective value
* Reshuffle the deck when their are 60 cards left in the whole deck

* Dealing:
	* every player gets a card face up clockwise
	* 1 card face up to dealer itself at the end
	* another round where every player gets a 2nd card face up
	* 1 card face DOWN for the dealer
* Blackjack:
	* if player has an ace and a "ten" card and dealer doesn't have a blackjacke he wins
	* if player and dealer have blackjack it's a tie
	* if player has something and dealer has blackjack, player looses

* Play:
	* clockwise every player takes turn (stand or card)
	* dealer reveals his 2nd card and has to take a new card until hits minimium of 17
	* Ace always counts as 11 when dealer turn ? 

* More Advanced stuff:

	* Splitting cards => If a player's first two cards are of the same denomination, such as two jacks or two sixes, he may choose to treat them as two separate hands when his turn comes around.
		* each split is handled differently. If Blackjacke you just get double bet not double and half

	* Double down => place another bed equal to the previous and get 3rd card facing down
	* Insurance:
		* When the dealer's face-up card is an ace, any of the players may make a side bet of up to half the original bet that the dealer's face-down card is a ten-card, and thus a blackjack for the house.
